# US Arrests-PCA
The purpose of this project was to find a pattern within US arrest rates. Most of all to see and measure racial bias. In light of the recent George Floyd protests, I felt it would be right to do a deep dive and take an analytical look at how these arrests rates measure from state to state, rural and urban to see what's the difference. I used principal component analysis and clustering to achieve this.

# My findings were as follows:

* That a high urban community does not necessarily mean a high murder rate.
* That there are areas with high murder rates but low to medium urban populations.
* The media sensationalises high murder rate, high urban population areas.
* There are areas with high murder and high urban populations but they're the only places with high police presence and attention. Chicago for Example.
* Gun violence is not an urban problem, it's an American problem that is being centered on urban communities, where as potential school shooters (the incel community) gets no attention.
